# hello-world
Hello GitHub, keep me accountable

  My name is Stephen and I grew up in a small town in Georgia, USA. I have a few certificates from a long college career but I never found out what I really wanted to do with my life. Growing up in the early 90's my grandfather on my dads side actually exposed me to some coding on a platform that ran on MS Dos (the name of the program escapes me) before we had a machine with windows 3.1. I am now 32 years old with college debt and no degree but I finally have a passion to learn something. While in college, I found out that I had a natural ability to do accounting (exciting right..). I knew that I would be miserable doing it which pretty much made it impossible for me to put in enough work to graduate. I moved to the bay area to be close to my sister and I want to start to create software.
